Development Tasks
Beta 1 tasks:
General
	- Test UI features for detecting modifications to arrangers/palettes/etc
	x Revise TileShopForm for external file loaders always loading into the root directory (Remember first-time TIM palette load automatically being modified)
	x Add drag/drop rearranging for the treeview
	- Revise menu option code (Close Project, Save Project As, etc)
	x Revise code so that the same resource cannot be opened in two editors at once
	x Disallow keyboard access to codec dropdown and remove highlight
	- Test support for renaming items (and simultaneously renaming all references)
	x Change XML to tree layout
	x Change XML graphic -> element
	x Remove required bitoffset XML exporting (default is 0)
	- Allow multiple projects to be loaded into ProjectTreeForm (prefix project node name into XML, put each project into separate tab or just top-level folder)
	- Design palette system (palette accessibility: TIMs need multiple bound palettes, tiles less so (only animations), stored in XML? How to add in UI?)
		- Have TIM plugin create multiple images for TIMs with multiple palettes
		- Apply palette button with drop-down menu showing available palettes (palettes already used elsewhere in the arranger)
		- Drop-down menu with "Other" option that allows selecting a palette from elsewhere in the project

GraphicsViewerChild
	x Add jump/goto address button for GraphicsViewerChild navigation
	- Implement editing support geared specifically towards linear graphics
	x Crashing bug when selecting a blank element in a ScatteredArranger (editing) -> Selection contains blank element and cannot be edited MessageBox popup
	- For drag+drop of elements from a ScatteredArranger->SequentialArranger, create a new temp Arranger with adjusted addresses, render, and save
	- Enforce drag+drop consistency between ScatteredArranger->SequentialArranger formats
	x Allow user to resize number of ScatteredArranger elements in UI
	- Add support to attach palettes to tiles for ScatteredArrangers
	- RenderPanel size issue with swapping codecs to/from PSX (linear) graphics

Codecs
	x Test encoding support for rowpixelpattern
	x Test encoding support for mergepriority

Pixel Editor
	- Add support for palettes in pixel editor (gray out pixels that cannot be edited using the current palette)

Beta 2 tasks:
Add more tools to the pixel editor (color cycling/remapping, flood fill, rectangle tool)
Add direct encoding/decoding
Switch file i/o to just-in-time for editing
*Fix sequential arranger offsets to be bitwise (Add variable width/height tile support)

Long term tasks:
Support for palettes with scattered color locations
Implement new PaletteColorFormats
Test NewPaletteForm (Add bitwise)

Misc tasks:
Change fixedsize in codec to fixedwidth and fixedheight (might not be necessary)
